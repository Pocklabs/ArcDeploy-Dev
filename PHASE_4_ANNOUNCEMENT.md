## 🎪 Demo: Failure Injection in Action

Here's what our new failure injection framework can do:

**Network Resilience Testing:**
- Simulate DNS failures and network partitions
- Test bandwidth throttling and packet loss scenarios
- Validate connection exhaustion handling

**Service Resilience Testing:**
- Test service crashes and resource exhaustion
- Validate configuration corruption recovery
- Simulate dependency failures

**System Resilience Testing:**
- Memory bombs and CPU exhaustion tests
- Disk I/O storms and inode exhaustion
- Swap thrashing and system resource limits

**All with automated recovery and cleanup!**
