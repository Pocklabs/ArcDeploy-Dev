## Port Migration Summary

| Component | Old Port | New Port(s) | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Blocklet Server HTTP | 8089 | 8080 | Main HTTP interface |

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Container-based)
```
User → Nginx (80/443) → Podman Container (8089) → Blocklet Server
```

### After (Native)
```
User → Nginx (80/443) → Native Blocklet Server (8080/8443)
                     ↘ Redis Backend
```

## Key Directory Changes

| Component | Old Path | New Path |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Main Directory | `/home/arcblock/blocklet-server` | `/opt/blocklet-server` |
| Data Directory | Container volumes | `/opt/blocklet-server/data` |
| Config Directory | Container volumes | `/opt/blocklet-server/config` |
| Logs Directory | Container volumes | `/opt/blocklet-server/logs` |
| Health Script | `/home/arcblock/blocklet-server/healthcheck.sh` | `/opt/blocklet-server/healthcheck.sh` |
